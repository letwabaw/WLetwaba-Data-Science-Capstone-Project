#Introduction
Project background and context​ 
  Space X advertises Falcon9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars, other providers cost upwards costs of 165 million dollars each . 
  The reason Space X can save this much is because they reuse the first stage.Therefore we act as Data Scientist to determine a prediction of whether Falcon 9 will make successful first stage landing so to 
  determine the cost of the launch.​

Problems you want to find answers​ 
 To determine the price of each launch. Whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage.​
 And train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX​ will reuse the first stage.

 Summary of methodologies​ 
   -We collect data about launch and landing specifications and outcomes, rockets used, payload delivered using Space X REST API​
   -We obtain the rocket launches data using web scrabing​
   -We process the data using Data Wrangling​
   -We select and sort the data using SQL queries on the data loaded into a Database(Db2)​
   -We do Exploratory Data analysis by writing Python codes manipulating the data into Panda Dataframes  for further analysis and visuals using scatter plots, bar charts, Folium maps(using Folium Library) and 
     Dashboards (using the Plotly Dash Python library).
Summary of all results​ 
  -Jupiter Notebooks that has codes and Powerpoint Presentation​
